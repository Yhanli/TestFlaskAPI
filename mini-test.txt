# problem - parse a document word count
# a list of all the words, and number of times it appears.

1. cleanse text:
    replace non-alphabetical characters to whitespace

    lowercase the entire text

    strip whitespaces in both end of text


2. process text:
    generate word list by split text using whitespaces

    create word empty dictionary

    for word in the word list

        strip white spaces of word

        if length of word less than 1 then skip to next word directly (skip below steps)
        
        if word is not a key of word dictionary
            add word as a key in word dictionary and assign value 1

        or else (word is a key of word dictionary)
            modify word(key) in dictionary by adding 1 to its value

    output word dictionary
